# WeLoveMovies: Backend Capstone Project

## A RESTful API designed using Express, PostgreSQL and Knex.

One key challenge I faced with this assignment was managing libraries/dependencies. Many of the middleware functions and configuration files require dependencies to function properly: CORS, Knex, and Dotenv are examples. Students are given a relatively blank slate to start, and completing the assignment correctly required installing a number of libraries and running a number of CLI commands.

One other significant challenge was selecting the correct data using Knex, setting up tables correctly, and testing this accurately using Postman and DBeaver. Less visual feedback is available when developing an API than a frontend, so it was up to me to figure out how to check if things were working.
